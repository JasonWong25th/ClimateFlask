'''
User management is a critical component of any website. This file does two differnet things:

1) This file users Googles API to securely authenticate the users to this site. Mostly you just want to leave the code that does this
alone.

2) This file manages how users are described on the site.  This could be given users the ability to change their names from how they
are in Google or changing their default picture or managing other values that are unique to your application like is the user
an administrator etc.

Users are managed by several different files: 
* in app/classes/data.py there is a User data class that defines what data fields are stored for each user
* in app/classes/formd.py there is a UserForm class that defines what fields can be edited for each user
* There is this file which does all the hard work.  the /login and /editprofile routes are were you might
want to make changes for your site 
* in app/templates/profile.html and app/templates/editprofile.html are the templates that are used to 
display and edit information about the users
